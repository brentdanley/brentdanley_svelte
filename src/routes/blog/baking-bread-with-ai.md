I've baked this bread loaf recipe several times. I know how to do it. I rarely want the nice, big cookbook out while I'm baking. I don't want it to get stained or wet, it takes up too much precious counter space, and frankly the recipe is far too detailed for what I need. When I first baked this bread, the lengthy descriptions were helpful. Now, all I need are the ingredients and the basic instructions.
