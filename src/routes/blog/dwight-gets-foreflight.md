### Prompt

Write me a scene from The Office where ForeFlight enthusiast Brent tries to convince a sarcastic and grumpy Dwight Schrute to replace his Android tablet (which doesn’t run ForeFlight) with an iPad.

### ChatGPT

**Brent:** Hey, Dwight, I noticed you’re still using that old Android tablet for your flight planning.

**Dwight:** Yeah, so?

**Brent:** Well, I just think you’d benefit from using an iPad. It’s a lot more user-friendly and it runs ForeFlight, which is the best app for pilots.

**Dwight:** (sarcastically) Oh, I see. You want me to spend more money on a fancy device just so I can use your precious ForeFlight app.

**Brent:** (excitedly) Yeah, exactly! You’ll love it, Dwight. It’s so easy to use and it has all the features you need for flight planning.

**Dwight:** (grumpily) I’m sure it’s wonderful, but I don’t see the point in replacing my perfectly good tablet just for some app I might use once in a while.

**Brent:** (persistently) Come on, Dwight. You’re a pilot. You need the best tools to do your job. And ForeFlight is the best tool out there for flight planning. Plus, you can do so much more with an iPad than you can with an Android tablet.

**Dwight:** (skeptically) Really? Like what?

**Brent:** (eagerly) Well, for starters, you can access all your flight documents and charts right on the iPad. You can also get real-time weather updates and access your flight logs and flight plan. Plus, you can use it for navigation in the cockpit and even record your flights. It’s like a mini-flight deck in the palm of your hand.

**Dwight:** (sarcastically) Wow, that sounds absolutely amazing. I can’t believe I’ve been missing out on all this.

**Brent:** (excitedly) I know, right? And the best part is, you can even use it to play Angry Birds in the cockpit. (laughs)

**Dwight:** (rolling his eyes) Great. Just what I need. Another way to distract myself from flying the plane.

**Brent:** (smiling) Come on, Dwight. You know you want one. And you’ll thank me when you’re soaring through the skies with ForeFlight on your iPad.

**Dwight:** (grumpily) Fine. I’ll think about it.

**Brent:** (triumphantly) Yes! I knew you’d come around. Let’s go to the Apple store and get you set up with an iPad and ForeFlight. You won’t regret it.

**Dwight:** (sighing) Let’s just get this over with. (exits the office with Brent)
