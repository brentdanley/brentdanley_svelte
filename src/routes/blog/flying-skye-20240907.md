Took Skye flying yesterday. We intended to attend the [International Seaplane Fly-In](https://www.seaplanefly-in.org/) up in Greensville, Maine, but there was an overcast layer around 1,500' just north of Portland, with no end in sight, so we turned around.

We were on autopilot pretty much the whole time, as she didn't want to fly and I just wanted to enjoy my time with her.

I did butter the landing at Portland.
