## Daily Notes

For many persons, daily notes are for archiving activities or journaling. For me, it's a place in the morning to plan my day in terms of to-dos and meetings, and from then on they act as a scratch paper. I don't refer back to them, and many of the notes I write on them I later move to their own notes for further development.

I use the _Daily Notes_ [[#^core-plugins]] as well as the _Calendar_ community plugin for this.

My Daily Note is based on a _Templater_ template.

```markdown
# Daily Note for {{date:dddd[, ]MMM DD[, ]YYYY}}

## My usecases

### Learning

I have a Templater template called "Knowledge Gap" that is triggered with the Quick Add plugin. It's super basic, popping up a dialog asking about the thing I want to learn more about, then it creates a note and adds it to a "Knowledge Gap" folder that I can open later and fill out the note as I do research and learn about the thing. It's a primary Obsidian use case for me.

### Memory Aid

There are many thing I need to recall and don't have committed to memory, like certain terminal commands or how to log into and run a local server environment, for example. I keep these notes in Obsidian, and possibly add tags to the frontmatter for ease of search.

### Ideas

I make notes to capture ideas and plan for things like trips I want to take, remodels of the loft, or gifts for Skye.

### Features I Love ❤️

1. (Back)Linking to other notes with the [[]] syntax. This allows you to create a note for something like "My Jeep" and then have notes about your mechanic, certain parts, maybe a history of upgrades, etc. so you have this whole connected mindmap of your Jeep activities.
2. Create a new future note anwhere along with a backlink by simply wrapping a word(s) in square brackets. When you click on this link, it'll create a note. You can also search on these, like tags, even if you never use it to [create a note].
3. [Callouts](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Use+callouts) are incredibly. Quickly draw attention to important little snippets and notes in a visually appealing way.
4. Tabs - A new core feature, and very powerful.
5. Plugins - Whether you want to add interactive maps to your notes or create complex tables or drawings, there are plugins to make it easy. Obsidian can be what you want it to be, simple or complex. I prefer simple.
6. Vim support, but I know I'm not like most.
7. Markdown - This is something that sets Obsidian apart. The notes are wholly mine, non-proprietary, and portable. Writing in markdown syntax is super natural and intuitive, and Obsidian immediately generates previews even while editing (a recent feature).
8. Themes - Make Obsidian your own. Start with a theme and customize with your own JS and CSS. It's build on the web standards we know and love, so go crazy.

## Have fun.

Use Cmd+, to access preferences (just like every other Mac app). Peruse the community plugins and myriad settings options. Create templates. And when you come up with something super neat, be sure to let me know. My setup is super simple and fairly minimal, but I don't know what I'd do without it and I'm sure there are loads of things I could be doing with it, but don't.
