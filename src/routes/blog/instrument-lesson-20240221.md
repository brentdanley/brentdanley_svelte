Went flying with John Wednesday evening. The instrument scan is still pretty overwhelming, but I get that it will take time to relax, quickly identify what's not correct, and do anything else.

At one point John tapped on his window, then asked, "Did you hear that?" I acknowledged that I had heard the knocking, but didn't dare shift focus from the instrument scan. Then he clarified, "That's your CDI. It wants to come back in." Doh! I hadn't realized I'd flown off course while trying to maintain attitude, heading, and altitude!
