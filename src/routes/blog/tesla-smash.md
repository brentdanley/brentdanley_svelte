**TL;DR:** A Jeep hit my new Tesla and didn’t leave any information. Tesla's Sentry system recorded the incident, and it was instrumental in identifying the woman responsible. Her insurance will cover the repairs. She received a citation from the police for the crime of hit and run. Officer George of the Portland Police Department was fantastic.

On Thursday, August 1, I experienced firsthand the incredible capabilities of [Tesla’s Sentry Mode](https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/model3/en_us/GUID-56703182-8191-4DAE-AF07-2FDC0EB64663.html) when my 2024 Model 3 Performance was hit while parked in the Temple Street Parking Garage. I left the garage at 13:30 to attend a sailing lesson, after which I found a large dent and scratches on the passenger side front quarter-panel. It was a disappointing discovery, but I was hopeful that my Tesla’s advanced technology had captured what happened.

Tesla’s Sentry Mode uses the car’s array of cameras to continuously monitor its surroundings, even when parked. This feature automatically saves video footage when an incident occurs, providing invaluable evidence in situations like mine. Sure enough, the video captured not only the Jeep that hit my car, but also the driver and exact time of the incident (11:34).

Hopeful for some community support, I shared the video on [Nextdoor](https://nextdoor.com/news_feed). Someone, I hoped, knew this person and could help the police find her. The response was overwhelming, with many people offering helpful suggestions and expressing their frustration over the situation. It was heartening to see so many individuals coming together to support a neighbor in need.

Armed with the video evidence, I contacted the Portland Police Department and filed an official report. Officer George, who handled my case, was impressed by the clear footage and indicated that this level of evidence might actually lead to a resolution, which is rare in these types of cases.

Throughout the process, Officer George was not only professional but also genuinely concerned about the situation. He contacted me periodically to provide updates and gather additional evidence and information. His dedication to the case made it clear that he wasn’t just doing a job—he cared about ensuring that justice was served. The cooperation between myself, the police, and even the parking garage staff, who assisted by providing additional video footage, was crucial in moving this case forward.

A few days later, I noticed a Jeep resembling the one in the video parked in the same garage. I decided to leave a polite note, along with my contact information, and a frame from the video showing the incident. My intention was simple: to give the criminal an opportunity to do the right thing.

The next day, I received a call from Lilybeth, the driver, who explained why she had left the scene without leaving a note. While the conversation was a bit disheartening, I appreciated that she provided her insurance information, allowing me to move forward with repairs.

My insurance company handled everything smoothly, and the parking garage staff did their best to assist by providing footage that might have been helpful to the investigation. While that footage didn’t yield any new leads, the overall collaboration with everyone involved was encouraging.

Back into parking spaces. If you hit a car while driving, leave your contact and insurance information. If the vehicle you hit is a Tesla, there's a good chance you were recorded with one or more of its cameras.
