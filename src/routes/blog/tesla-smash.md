**TL;DR:** A Jeep hit my new Tesla and didn’t leave any information. Tesla's Sentry system recorded the incident, and it was instrumental in identifying the woman responsible. Her insurance will cover the repairs. She received a citation from the police for the crime of hit and run. Officer George of the Portland Police Department was fantastic.

On Thursday, August 1, I experienced firsthand the incredible capabilities of [Tesla’s Sentry](https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/model3/en_us/GUID-56703182-8191-4DAE-AF07-2FDC0EB64663.html) when my 2024 Model 3 Performance was hit while parked in the Temple Street Parking Garage. I left the garage at 13:30 to attend a sailing lesson, after which I found a large dent and scratches on the passenger side front quarter-panel. It was a disappointing discovery, but I was hopeful that my Tesla’s advanced technology had captured what happened.

## Tesla Security

My 2024 Tesla Model 3 Performance is equipped with an array of cameras looking in every direction. These cameras provide the car with "vision," enabling its Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Auto Park capabilities. But they also serve a critical role in security, which is divided into [Sentry and Dashcam](https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/model3/en_us/GUID-49096E34-97D2-4182-9414-2F7F4E88EE79.html). Videos for the previous hour of driving are recorded to a USB storage device located in the glove box, as well as any saved Sentry or Dashcam footage.

### Sentry

Tesla’s Sentry continuously monitor its surroundings when parked. Any suspicious activity triggers the system to automatically save the previous 10 minutes of video, providing invaluable evidence in situations like mine.

The footage from this incident captured not only the Jeep that hit my car but also the driver and the exact time of the impact (11:34). Interestingly, Sentry Mode recorded two separate events: one when the Jeep made contact, and another when the woman walked closely in front of my car as she left the parking garage. If she hadn’t triggered the second event, I wouldn’t have captured the crucial moments of her Jeep backing away and her inspecting the damage from inside the vehicle. I was able to stitch these videos together, combining footage from both the front and right-side cameras, to create a complete narrative of the incident—from before the impact to when she walked out of the garage.

I do wish Tesla would save several minutes of video after incidents as well.

### Dashcam

Dashcam works similarly but is active when the car is driving. If an incident occurs on the road, Dashcam will save the previous 10 minutes of video leading up to the event. Drivers can also manually record a Dashcam video at any time by pressing the horn or a button on the display.

Hopeful for some community support, I shared the video on [Nextdoor](https://nextdoor.com/news_feed). Someone, I hoped, knew this person and could help the police find her. The response was overwhelming, with many people offering helpful suggestions and expressing their frustration over the situation. It was heartening to see so many individuals coming together to support a neighbor in need.

Armed with the video evidence, I contacted the Portland Police Department and filed an official report. Officer George, who handled my case, was impressed by the clear footage and indicated that this level of evidence might actually lead to a resolution, which is rare in these types of cases.

Throughout the process, Officer George was not only professional but also genuinely concerned about the situation. He contacted me periodically to provide updates and gather additional evidence and information. His dedication to the case made it clear that he wasn’t just doing a job—he cared about ensuring that justice was served. The cooperation between myself, the police, and even the parking garage staff, who assisted by providing additional video footage, was crucial in moving this case forward.

A few days later, I noticed a Jeep resembling the one in the video parked in the same garage. I decided to leave a polite note, along with my contact information, and a frame from the video showing the incident. My intention was simple: to give the criminal an opportunity to do the right thing.

The next day, I received a call from Lilybeth, the driver, who explained why she had left the scene without leaving a note. While the conversation was a bit disheartening, I appreciated that she provided her insurance information, allowing me to move forward with repairs.

My insurance company handled everything smoothly, and the parking garage staff did their best to assist by providing footage that might have been helpful to the investigation. While that footage didn’t yield any new leads, the overall collaboration with everyone involved was encouraging.

Back into parking spaces. If you hit a car while driving, leave your contact and insurance information. If the vehicle you hit is a Tesla, there's a good chance you were recorded with one or more of its cameras.

## Tesla Security

My 2024 Tesla Model 3 Performance has cameras looking in every direction. These cameras enable the car to have "vision", which is used for its Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Auto Park capabilities. It utilizes these same cameras for security, which is divided into [Sentry and Dashcam](https://www.tesla.com/ownersmanual/model3/en_us/GUID-49096E34-97D2-4182-9414-2F7F4E88EE79.html).

### Sentry

When parked and Sentry is active, any suspicious activity will cause the previous 10 minutes of videos from the cameras to be saved.

Sentry can be set to not record events at home, work, or any favorite locations. This preserves the battery when in a known safe location.

### Dashcam

Dashcam is like Sentry, except for when the car is driving. Like Sentry, if there's an incident on the road, Dashcam will save the previous 10 minutes of video leading up to the incident. At any time, the driver can manually record a Dashcam video by pressing the horn or a button on the display.

What's interesting about this incident is that Sentry recorded TWO events, one when the Jeep hit the car, and another when the woman walked closely in front of my car when leaving the parking garage. If she hadn't triggered the second event by walking near my car, I wouldn't have gotten the video of her Jeep backing away, and her inspecting the damage while still inside her Jeep. I wish Tesla would save several minutes of video AFTER incidents.
