<h1>Pilot Logbook</h1>

<p>
	I earned my private pilot certificate way back on October 7, 1998. My first kid would be born less
	than a year later, followed by our second in 2001 and third in 2003. Between raising kids, going
	to school, moving to Maine, and then having my world dumped upside-down when my wife died in 2016,
	flying was often not a priority. I thought about it a lot, though; blue skies always beckoned me
	to return to them.
</p>
<p>
	In 2021 I accepted a position at ForeFlight, after which I returned to flight with a vengeance!
</p>
<p>I love how my logbook data not only tells the story of my flying, but also of my life.</p>
